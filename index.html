            <p>Welcome to our class's final projects showcase! In "Creative Writing for Social Research," we explore arts-based methods in research, using creative writing as a tool for inquiry, analysis, and representation. These projects demonstrate how we've applied these approaches to examine social phenomena through poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and hybrid forms.</p>

                <h3><a href=" https://downtownviews.art.blog/ ">Downtown Views</a></h3>
                <p class="project-author">Chelsey Ignacio</p>
                <p>Commuters’ stories are central here in Downtown Views, offering a glimpse into the ups and downs of the current transportation system, as well as confessions on the costs of convenience. The participating commuters are employees with various work arrangements. They share their own photographs and writings featuring their travels to and/or from their offices in selected CBDs across Metro Manila. Employing a mix of ekphrastic and experiential methodologies, Downtown Views seeks to capture more raw and diverse insights and sentiments on metropolitan mobility and city centers, where urban development has long been marred by socioeconomic inequities.

                <p class="project-author">Christine Sejera</p>
                <p>This project is an offshoot of the proponent’s previous communication study that examined the media's portrayal of women in the 2022 Philippine National Elections. Building on these findings, this project investigates the perceptions of Filipino women voters regarding the 2022 elections, focusing on the social, cultural, economic, and political factors and their voting decisions concerning Leni Robredo and Sara Duterte. The aim is to understand how these factors shaped their views and ultimately their votes, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of women's political participation and the impact of gendered narratives. It employed an unstructured interview approach combined with photovoice to express the three Filipino women voters’ experiences related to the 2022 Philippine National Elections, offering insights into their perspectives rooted in their daily lives, aspirations, values, and cultural pressures. </p>

                <p>A menstrual health awareness project for Panay communities, developed as part of the Atipan+ Gender Audit 2025. The research explores how socio-cultural factors shape menstrual experiences, using a creative, participatory methodology that blends storytelling, visual mapping, and performance to challenge stigma and amplify rural communities. This arts-based approach fosters open dialogue while centering the lived experiences of women and menstruators in rural Philippines.</p>
