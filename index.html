            <p>Welcome to our class's final projects showcase! In "Creative Writing for Social Research," we explore arts-based methods in research, using creative writing as a tool for inquiry, analysis, and representation. These projects demonstrate how we've applied these approaches to examine social phenomena through poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and hybrid forms.</p>

                <p>A menstrual health awareness project for Panay communities, developed as part of the Atipan+ Gender Audit 2025. The research explores how socio-cultural and geographic factors shape menstrual experiences, using a creative, participatory methodology that blends storytelling, visual mapping, and performance to challenge stigma and amplify marginalized voices. This arts-based approach fosters open dialogue while centering the lived experiences of women and menstruators in rural Philippines..</p>
